	<span class="text-primary"><strong>Summary:</strong></span><br>The sidebar provides 
	inputs that allow you to filter the data by many different attributes. Data 
	filters should be used when you wish to remove data.<br><br>
	<span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Tips:</strong></span><br>
	Often, the "subplot variable" or "color variable" inputs on a plot panel can 
	be used instead of filtering the data. For example, setting the "subplot 
	variable" to "residency" creates subplots for "residents" and "non-residents" 
	(rather than using filters to remove non-residents)<br><br>If you are 
	changing many filters at once, then you should close all the plot panels. 
	Expanded plot panels are automatically updated 2 seconds after filter inputs 
	stop changing.<br><br>By default, entries with missing values for a 
	particular attribute are included because blank or empty filters are not 
	applied. To filter out entries with missing values, set the attribute filter 
	to include all possible values (e.g., check both "resident" and 
	"non-resident" to remove items with missing residency values)<br><br><span class="text-danger">
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Caution:</strong></span><br>
	The filter sidebar removes data from the analysis. In some situations this 
	may be undesirable. For example, filtering data by age may lead to incorrect 
	estimates of churn if the age filter removes future purchases.</div>
