	<span class="text-primary"><strong>Summary:</strong></span><br>Customer recruitment 
	is defined as the gain of customers. By default, a customer is classified as 
	a recruit if they did not purchase in the previous 5 years (i.e., a moving window 
	analysis). The recruitment rate is defined as the number of recruits in the 
	current year divided by the total number of customers the previous year.<br>
	<br><span class="text-primary"><strong>Grouping Variables:<br></strong>
	</span>When a variable is selected from the color variable menu customers are 
	divided into groups. <br><br>For all grouping variables except "Age group", 
	customers are divided into groups before they are classified as recruit/not 
	recruit. For example, a customer who purchases a deer permit for the first time 
	will be classified as a recruit within the deer item type group, even if they 
	regularly purchase a fishing license. Therefore, the sum of the reported number 
	of recruits when a color variable is selected may be greater than the reported 
	number of recruits when "Total" is selected.<br><br>An exception is made when 
	"Age group" is used as a grouping variable. If "Age group" is selected, then 
	customers are classfied as recruit/not recruit before they are divided into 
	groups. Therefore, the sum of the reported number of recruits by age group will 
	equal the number of recruits when "Total" is selected.<br><br>
	<span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Tips:</strong></span><br>
	To remove "(Missing)" group, activate filter by selecting all values. For example, 
	check boxes for "Female" and "Male" on gender filter to remove entries with 
	missing values for gender attribute. <br><br><span class="text-danger">
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Caution:</strong></span><br>
	If the data is filtered by age and/or year, then customers may be incorrectly 
	classified as recruits if the filters remove their previous purchases.<br>
	<br>Customers may purchase multiple item types and therefore the sum of the 
	number of recruits by item type may be greater than the total (see above).</div>
