	<span class="text-primary"><strong>Summary:</strong></span><br>Customer churn 
	(a.k.a., attrition, turnover, or defection) is defined as the permanent loss 
	of customers. By default, a customer is classified as a churned if they do not 
	purchase in the next 5 years (i.e., a moving window analysis). The churn rate 
	is defined as the number of customers lost after the current year divided by 
	the total number of customers in the current year. The churn rate is the complement 
	of the retention rate (i.e., customers who do not churn are retained).<br>
	<br><span class="text-primary"><strong>Grouping Variables:<br></strong>
	</span>When a variable is selected from the color variable menu customers are 
	divided into groups. <br><br>For all grouping variables except "Age group", 
	customers are divided into groups before they are classified as churned/not 
	churned. For example, a customer who stops purchasing deer permits will be classified 
	as churned within the deer item type group, even if they continue to purchase 
	fishing licenses. Therefore, the sum of the reported number of churned customers 
	when a color variable is selected may be greater than the reported number of 
	churned customers when "Total" is selected.<br><br>An exception is made when 
	"Age group" is used as a grouping variable. If "Age group" is selected, then 
	customers are classfied as churned/not churned before they are divided into 
	groups. Therefore, the sum of the reported number of churned customers by age 
	group will equal the number of churned customers when "Total" is selected.<br>
	<br><span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Tips:</strong></span><br>
	To remove "(Missing)" group, activate filter by selecting all values. For example, 
	check boxes for "Female" and "Male" on gender filter to remove entries with 
	missing values for gender attribute. <br><br>You can change the size of moving 
	window on the "Options" tab. Try decreasing the window size to 1 year without 
	purchase to obtain more recent estimates of churn.<br><br>
	<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Caution:</strong></span><br>
	If the data is filtered by age and/or year, then customers may be incorrectly 
	classified as churned if the filters remove their future purchases.<br><br>Customers 
	may purchase multiple item types and therefore the sum of the number of churned 
	customers by item type may be greater than the total (see above).</div>
