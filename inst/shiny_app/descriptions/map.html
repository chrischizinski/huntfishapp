	<span class="text-primary"><strong>Summary:</strong></span><br>The map panel 
	can display the number of permits, number of items, churn rate, recruitment 
	rate, or participation rate.<br><br>Churn rate is the number of customers lost 
	after the current year divided by the total number of customers in the current 
	year. Lost customers are defined as those who do not purchase in the next 5 
	permit years.<br><br>Recruitment rate is the number of recruits in the current 
	year divided by the total number of customers the previous year. Recruits are 
	defined as an individual that did not purchase in the 5 previous permit years.<br>
	<br>Participation rate is defined as the percent of the population purchasing 
	at least one permit. Population estimates are 5-year estimates from the 2013-2017 
	American Community Survey (ACS).<br><br><span class="text-primary"><strong>Grouping 
	Variables:<br></strong></span>The primary variable is calculate separately for 
	each group. The main grouping variable is either county or state depending on 
	the selected reporting region.The subplot variable drop down menu can be used 
	to specify additional grouping variables.<br><br><span class="text-success">
	<i class="fa fa-lightbulb fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Tips:</strong></span><br>
	To remove "(Missing)" group, activate filter by selecting all values. For example, 
	check boxes for "Female" and "Male" on gender filter to remove entries with 
	missing values for gender attribute. <br><br>Instead of selecting a subplot 
	variable, try setting the filters on the sidebar and downloading a plot from 
	the "Save plot" tab. Saved plots may be easier to compare because the colors 
	are scaled to each plot. <br><br><span class="text-danger">
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Caution:</strong></span><br>
	The county and state variables are defined in the database. Check with your 
	database administrator to see if these variables are simply the most recent 
	information or if they can change over time as customers move.</div>
