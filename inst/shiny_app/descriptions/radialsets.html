	Radial Sets plot panel displays a graphic based on a Radial Sets diagram.
	<br><br>In our simplified version of a Radial Sets diagram, there is an outside 
	ring with sections for each item type. The sections are sized according to the 
	total number of customers who purchased each item type irrespective of other 
	purchases. <br><br>Inside each section of the ring, there are four bars indicating 
	the number of customers who purchased only that item type, one additional type, 
	two additional types, or three or more additional types.<br><br>Inside the ring 
	of the donut plot, there are edges (i.e., lines) connecting the nodes (i.e., 
	sections). The width of the edges indicates the percent overlap between the 
	two customer groups relative to the total number of customers in both groups. 
	For example, the edge between the “hunt” group and the “deer” group indicates 
	the percent of all hunt and deer permit-buyers who purchased both permits.
	<br><br>A drop-down menu input allows the user to select between sizing the 
	edges by percent or number of customers. The “focus item type” drop-down menu 
	input allows the user to select a single item type on which to focus. If the 
	user selects an item type from the “focus group” menu, then all edges not connected 
	to that type are removed. The edges are rescaled to indicate the percent of 
	customers in the focus group who also purchased each additional type. <br>
	<br>The visualization is a simplified version of an Radial Sets plot:<br>&nbsp;<div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 1; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">

	Try setting the filters on the sidebar and downloading a plot from the "Save
