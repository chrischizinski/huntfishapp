	<span class="text-primary"><strong>Summary:</strong></span><br>The number of 
	customers is calculated as the sum of the number of unique customer ID's. The 
	number of items is calculated as the total number of rows. <br>
	<span class="text-primary"><strong><br>Grouping Variables:<br></strong>
	</span>The number of customers (or items) is calculate separately for each group. 
	By default, the item year is included as a grouping variable. If the reporting 
	period is monthly, then month is included as an additonal grouping variable. 
	If the reporting period is daily, then the issue date is included as a grouping 
	variable. The subplot variable and color variable drop down menus can be used 
	to specify additional grouping variables.<br><br><span class="text-success">
	<i class="fa fa-lightbulb fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Tips:</strong></span><br>
	To remove "(Missing)" group, activate filter by selecting all values. For example, 
	check boxes for "Female" and "Male" on gender filter to remove entries with 
	missing values for gender attribute. <br><br>By default, all subplots will have 
	the same scale. The y-axis scales can be changed on the &quot;Options&quot; 
	tab.<br><br><span class="text-danger">
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Caution:</strong></span><br>
	Customers may purchase multiple item types and therefore the sum of the number 
	of customers by item type may be greater than the total. </div>
