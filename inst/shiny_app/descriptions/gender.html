	of customers purchasing in a given time period. <br>
	<span class="text-primary"><strong><br>Grouping Variables:<br></strong>
	</span>The proportion of female and male customers is calculated separately 
	for each group. By default, the item year is included as a grouping variable. 
	If the reporting period is monthly, then month is included as an additonal grouping 
	variable. If the reporting period is daily, then the issue date is included 
	as a grouping variable. The subplot variable drop down menu can be used to specify 
	additional grouping variables.<br><br><span class="text-success">
	<i class="fa fa-lightbulb fa-1x"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Tips:</strong></span><br>
	To remove "(Missing)" group, activate filter by selecting all values. For example, 
	check boxes for "Female" and "Male" on gender filter to remove entries with 
	missing values for gender attribute. <br><br><span class="text-danger">
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-1x"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Caution:</strong></span><br>
	Customers may purchase multiple item types and therefore the sum of the number 
	of customers by item type may be greater than the total. </div>
