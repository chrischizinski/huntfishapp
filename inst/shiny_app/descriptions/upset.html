	<span class="text-primary"><strong>Summary:</strong></span><br>The permit combinations 
	UpSet visualization displays the number of customers with a particular combination 
	of items. The visualization consists of a top bar plot, a side bar plot, and 
	a table with dots and lines. <br><br>The top bar plot has a bar for each combination 
	of items. However, since there is a very large number of possible combinations, 
	only those combinations with a large number of customers are displayed. The 
	number of bars in the top bar plot is controlled by the "item combinations" 
	input. A customer will only be counted in a single bar in the top bar plot. 
	For example, a customer who purchased a deer permit and a fish license will 
	be counted in the bar corresponding to the deer and fish combination.<br>
	<br>The columns in the table are the bar labels for the top bar plot. The table 
	has rows corresponding to item types and columns corresponding to combinations 
	of item types. For example, the deer and fish combination of items is indicated 
	by a dot in the deer row, a dot in the fish row, and a vertical line connecting 
	the dots. The bar above this column in the table indicates the number of customers 
	who purchased a deer permit and fish license in a single year.<br><br>The rows 
	in the table are the bar labels for the side bar plot. The side bar plot indicates 
	the total number of customers who purchased each item type. In the side bar 
	plot, a customer will be counted multiple times if they purchased multiple items. 
	For example, a customer who purchased a deer permit and a fish license will 
	be counted in the horizontal bar next to the fish row and in the horizontal 
	bar next to the deer row. The number of customers in the deer bar of the side 
	bar plot is the total of all the customers from the permit combinations (i.e., 
	bars in the top bar plot) that included the purchase of a deer permit. <br>
	<br>The visualization is a simplified version 
	of an UpSet plot:<br>&nbsp;<div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 1; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">
